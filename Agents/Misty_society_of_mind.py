class SocietyOfMindAgent(ConversableAgent):
    """(In preview) A single agent that runs a Group Chat as an inner monologue.
    At the end of the conversation (termination for any reason), the SocietyOfMindAgent
    applies the response_preparer method on the entire inner monologue message history to
    extract a final answer for the reply.

    Most arguments are inherited from ConversableAgent. New arguments are:
        chat_manager (GroupChatManager): the group chat manager that will be running the inner monologue
        response_preparer (Optional, Callable or String): If response_preparer is a callable function, then
                it should have the signature:
                    f( self: SocietyOfMindAgent, messages: List[Dict])
                where `self` is this SocietyOfMindAgent, and `messages` is a list of inner-monologue messages.
                The function should return a string representing the final response (extracted or prepared)
                from that history.
                If response_preparer is a string, then it should be the LLM prompt used to extract the final
                message from the inner chat transcript.
                The default response_preparer depends on if an llm_config is provided. If llm_config is False,
                then the response_preparer deterministically returns the last message in the inner-monolgue. If
                llm_config is set to anything else, then a default LLM prompt is used.
